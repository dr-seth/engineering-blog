When we were looking to build out an infrastructure in AWS ([Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com)), we took some time to understand how the [aws-cli](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli) (Universal Command Line Interface for Amazon Web Services) worked. With ideas from other projects found on [GitHub](https://github.com), we started wrapping commands in simple BASH scripts, and pointed it to CloudFormation templates written in JSON. From there [stax](https://github.com/monsantoco/stax) was born, and we have released it as open source under the [BSD 3-clause license](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).

It’s easy to get started with stax to create and manage CloudFormation stacks (aka stax) in AWS ([Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com)) and the project provides several CloudFormation templates, or you can use your own.

For launching new AWS instances with stax, you can use Linux (Debian GNU/Linux 7 and Ubuntu 14.04 are supported) and Apple OS X (tested on 10.10 and 10.9). When running with a default template, you will end up with a VPC setup like the following:

![AWS Stax Diagram](/img/aws-stax.png)

**NOTICE:** _As you can see, stax creates an AWS environment from scratch, so it needs to be run under an IAM user or role with permissions to create all AWS resources in your template, including potentially IAM roles. You should understand the risk associated with giving users these permissions in your AWS account before using stax._

CoreOS hosts run Docker containers on the Gateway and Service layer, while [Amazon Linux](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/) instances serve as NAT devices to direct traffic for the internal hosts. Additionally, one of the biggest requests we had was to simplify the connectivity to nodes once the stax was created. For this we have the `stax connect` function, that will ssh through the bastion/ssh host, and log you on to either a host on the gateway layer, or the services layer.

The Gateway layer:

```
$ ./stax connect gateway

So you’re logged into a gateway CoreOS box, and from the current `/etc/motd` you can see what version of CoreOS you are running.

Now we’ll login to the Service layer:

```
$ ./stax connect service

Keeping in mind that this is only available when you’re in development, no external access is allowed to internal nodes directly without the bastion/ssh host, and shutting it down when running in production is highly recommended.

Lastly a quick run of stax without arguments will show you the usage, giving you an idea of all lf the tasks the tool is capable of:

```
$ ./stax
Usage: stax [OPTIONS] COMMAND

Options:
  -c,--config=CONFIG       Use file CONFIG rather than config/vpc-default.json
  -d,--debug               Turn on verbose messages
  -h,--help                Output this message
  -j,--jump=IP             SSH through host with IP address IP
  -m,--module=MOD          Use config/MOD.json and template/MOD.json
  -t,--template=TEMPLATE   Use file TEMPLATE rather than template/vpc-default.json
  -v,--version             Print name and version information
  -y,--yes                 Do not prompt for confirmation

If an argument is required for a long option, so to the short. Same for
optional arguments.

Commands:
  add                Add functionality to an existing VPC
  check              Run various tests against an existing stax
  connect [TARGET]   Connect to bastion|gateway|service in the VPC stax over SSH
  create             Create a new VPC stax in AWS
  describe           Describe the stax created from this host
  delete             Delete the existing VPC stax

We hope that this tool will be useful to the community and look forward to feedback on what people think of it. We’re open to issues you might create or pull requests to make stax better.
